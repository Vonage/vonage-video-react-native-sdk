# Vonage Video React Native docs

**Important:** Note that the reference docs and samples are written for developer using OpenTok projects, not Vonage applications. A few details are incorrect for Vonage application developers. For example, when instantiating an `OTSession` object,
pass in an application ID (for the `apiKey` prop), not an API key. Also, links in
these docs and samples point to the OpenTok developer center, instead of the Vonage
Developer Center. A reference guide for Vonage application developers is in development.


The Vonage React Native SDK documentation is now maitained at https://developer.vonage.com/en/video/client-sdks/react-native/overview?source=video.
